        <div class="row" style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:large;font-weight:bold;">ScentAir Electronic Payment Terms and Conditions</span></div>
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight:bold;">BY CHECKING THE BOX,</span> Authorized Agent (“Agent”): <span style="font-weight:bold;">(a) certifies</span> that Agent (i) is authorized to sign and legally bind Subscriber to contracts and to select Subscriber’s recurring Payment Type, and (ii) has corrected any errors in the above fields and will supply accurate details about Subscriber’s Payment Type in the subsequent screens that are provided by Chase Paymentech; <span style="font-weight:bold;">(b) signs</span> the below “Enrollment & Authorization of Recurring Payments” (“<span style="font-weight:bold;">Authorization</span>”) on behalf of Subscriber, which Authorization is incorporated herein;
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight:bold;">(c) certifies</span> that Agent (i) has made a copy of the Authorization for Subscriber's records, and (ii) confirms Subscriber's signature and delivers the Authorization for ScentAir's acceptance (in its discretion); and <span style="font-weight:bold;">(d) consents</span> to the processing of any outstanding balance on Subscriber’s account and understands that the enrolled credit card will be charged in that amount without any further authorization.
        <br /><br /> <div class="row" style="text-align:center;"> <span style="text-align:center;font-size:large;font-style:italic;">Enrollment & Authorization of Recurring Payments (“Authorization”)</span><br /><br /></div>
        <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">General Terms:</span> The Subscriber named in the “Environmental Scent Service Agreement” (“ESS”) between Subscriber and ScentAir, hereby authorizes ScentAir, for the term of the ESS, to obtain funds from the “Payment Type” selected above for purposes of paying amounts, including late charges and other fees, now or later due from Subscriber as specified in ScentAir invoices (“<span style="font-weight:bold;">Invoice Amounts</span>”). Subscriber agrees that all ESS-related transactions are and will always be primarily for business purposes and that Subscriber is and will remain the owner of the bank, or credit card, account specified during enrollment (“<span style="font-weight:bold;">Enrollment Screens</span>”). Subscriber agrees that this Authorization will remain in effect until subscriber cancels it by providing notice via the below “Cancellation Mechanism” at least fifteen (15) days prior to the next invoice billing date. Subscriber agrees that it will still owe the Invoice Amount(s) to the extent ScentAir is not able to obtain payment via Subscriber’s Payment Type. ScentAir reserves all rights. As used above, “Cancellation Mechanism” means notice to ScentAir either (a) at 3810 Shutterfly Road, Suite 900, Charlotte, NC 28217 by certified mail, or (b) via email at <a href="mailto:customercare@scentair.com">customercare@scentair.com</a>, which notice shall state (i) the date of notice delivery and Subscriber’s Customer ID #, (ii) the effective date for cancellation of the recurring payment method, and (iii) the payment method Subscriber will use post-cancellation.
        <br /><br />
        Subscriber further agrees:
        <br /><br />
        <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">ACH Authorization.</span> If the “Payment Type” is “ACH CCD,” Subscriber agrees to the General Terms and to the rules of the National Automated Clearinghouse (“NACHA” or “ACH”) now or later in effect. In addition, Subscriber authorizes ScentAir to debit the Invoice Amounts (which may vary in amount) on, or shortly before or after, the invoice due date from the bank account indicated in the Enrollment Screens (as updated). Subscriber agrees to: (a) timely notify ScentAir of any changes in Subscriber’s account information; and (b) reimburse ScentAir for all penalties and fees incurred as a result of any rejection of ScentAir’s request for account funds for any reason, including insufficient or unavailable funds or as a result of the account not being properly configured (such as for ACH transactions). Subscriber agrees that if an Invoice Amount is returned unpaid: (a) ScentAir may at its discretion attempt to process it as allowed by applicable NACHA rules, and (b) ScentAir may also make an ACH debit for a returned item fee of at least $4.50 or any greater amount that ScentAir is directly or indirectly obligated by NACHA rules to bear in relation to returned items.
        <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">Credit Card Authorization. </span> If the “Payment Type” is “Credit Card,” Subscriber agrees to the General Terms. Subscriber also agrees to all terms of the ACH Authorization, except that the NACHA rules will not apply and these differences will apply: (i) the account will be Subscriber’s credit card account instead of its bank account and if a charge is rejected, ScentAir will not resubmit the charge or seek a returned item fee except as allowed by applicable card brand rules; and (ii) Subscriber acknowledges ScentAir’s cancellation and refund policies regarding ScentAir products.
        This Authorization supplements the ESS by providing the method and terms for payment by Subscriber of amounts due under the ESS.

        <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">Privacy.</span> Subscriber agrees to the terms contained in ScentAir’s Privacy Policy https://www.scentair.com/legal/privacy as they may be updated from time to time and agrees that it will refer to https://www.scentair.com/legal/privacy.html for all information related to ScentAir’s Privacy Policy and any additional rights Subscriber may have related to these Terms and Conditions and this Authorization, as well as any rights related to Subscriber’s data in general.
